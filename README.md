# spotify-api
Authorization from spotify api and a few functions that extract data.

This script authenticates the spotify app and lets you get data from tracks, artist, playlists etc.
The main function is the one to get the access token, but there are some to get data from an artist or a album.

# What you need to run it
- Spotify app for developer
- Client id and client secret (both inside app)
